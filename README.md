# Linear_Regression

Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental machine learning algorithms. It is often the starting point for many in their journey into the world of machine learning. In this project, we will explore a simple example of Linear Regression to predict housing prices. Additionally, we will discuss important performance metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which help us assess the quality of our model's predictions.

# Performance Metrics

To evaluate the performance of our Linear Regression model, we use several key metrics:

1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** MSE measures the average of the squared differences between predicted values and actual values. It provides a measure of the model's accuracy, with lower values indicating a better fit.

2. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** MAE calculates the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. It is useful for understanding the magnitude of errors but doesn't penalize large errors as strongly as MSE.

3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** RMSE is the square root of the MSE, which provides a measure of the typical magnitude of errors. RMSE is in the same units as the target variable, making it interpretable.
